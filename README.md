I recently completed a Power BI project that analyzes hotel guest data, revenue, hotel performance, and reservations for the years 2016-2017. The goal of this project is to provide insights into guest behavior, revenue trends, and overall hotel performance to help hospitality businesses make strategic, data-driven decisions. 🏨📊

🔍 Key Highlights of the Project:

Guest Demographics and Behavior: Analyzed guest data to uncover key demographics and behavior patterns over two years.

Revenue Analysis: Visualized monthly and seasonal revenue trends to identify peak periods and revenue drivers.

Hotel Performance Comparison: Compared multiple hotels' performance metrics to highlight top-performing properties and areas needing improvement.

Reservation Patterns: Examined reservation data to understand booking patterns, cancellation rates, and the impact of different channels on overall occupancy.

💡 These insights enable hotels to optimize their operations, tailor marketing efforts, and enhance guest experiences, ultimately driving growth and profitability.

Stay tuned for more details on the project findings and interactive dashboards! 😊

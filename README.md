🚀 New Power BI Project: Analyzing Hotel Ratings 🚀

I’ve recently completed a Power BI project focusing on hotel ratings to uncover key trends and insights from customer feedback. This project aims to help hospitality businesses understand their strengths and areas for improvement, enhancing guest experiences and boosting customer satisfaction. 🏨✨

🔍 What Does the Project Cover?

Ratings Distribution and Trend Analysis: Visualized trends over time to identify patterns in guest satisfaction.
Sentiment Analysis: Analyzed customer reviews to categorize feedback into positive, neutral, and negative sentiments.
Performance by Category: Evaluated different aspects such as cleanliness, service, and amenities to see which areas are rated the highest or need improvement.
Competitor Benchmarking: Compared ratings with competitor hotels to find opportunities for competitive differentiation.
💡 Understanding guest feedback is crucial for any hotel looking to stay ahead in a competitive market. Data-driven insights like these can drive better decision-making and help create exceptional guest experiences!

More details on my findings and dashboards will be shared soon. Stay tuned! 😊
